ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cmaggi203

I am software Enginner and have experience for 9 years.
I'm an engineer who likes solving problems and finding ways to make things work better, especially through
automation. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed figuring things outâ€”itâ€™s like putting together a puzzle. I like working on my
own when I need to focus, but I also enjoy bouncing ideas off teammates and building things together. I just
try to do good, honest work that helps the team and keeps things moving.
